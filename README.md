## Overview

This repository contains the solution to the **CS4031 - Compiler Construction** course assignment for **Spring 2025**. The objective of this assignment was to design and implement various components of a custom programming language compiler. The project includes several key elements such as:

- **Regular Expressions (RE), Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)**
- **Lexical Analyzer** for tokenizing the input source code.
- **Symbol Table** for managing variables, functions, and constants.
- **Error Handler** to detect rule violations.
- **Transition State Table** for better clarity in parsing and state transitions.

This project demonstrates an understanding of the theory and practical application of compiler construction.

---

## Assignment Requirements

### 1. **Regular Expression (RE), NFA, and DFA**

Before implementing the lexical analyzer, we developed a workflow for the **NFA** and **DFA** based on regular expressions. The program can:

- **Create NFA** from regular expressions.
- **Convert NFA to DFA** using subset construction.
- Display the **total number of states** and a **transition state table** for each automaton.

### 2. **Lexical Analyzer**

The lexical analyzer reads the source code and breaks it into meaningful tokens. The analyzer is capable of:

- Recognizing and counting **different types of tokens**.
- Handling **pre-processing** for case sensitivity and whitespace.
- Managing **multiline comments** and **single-line comments**.
- Ensuring **arithmetic operations** and **variables** are properly tokenized.

### 3. **Symbol Table**

The **symbol table** is responsible for managing the program's identifiers. It handles:

- **Datatypes**: Boolean, Integer, Decimal, and Character.
- **Input/Output operations**.
- **Constants**: Both local and global constants.
- **Arithmetic operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulus.
- Proper handling of **scope management** for variables.
  
The symbol table supports operations related to **variable declarations**, **constants**, **data types**, and ensures the integrity of **arithmetic operations** in the language.

### 4. **Error Handler**

The **Error Handler** identifies and reports violations of syntax rules, including:

- **Invalid syntax** for arithmetic operations.
- **Undeclared variables**.
- **Mismatched data types**.
- **Misuse of constants or variables**.
- Errors are flagged with the **line number** and **error description** for clarity.

### 5. **Additional Features**

- **Transition State Table**: This table visually represents the state transitions for each token parsing step, making it easier to debug and understand the parsing process.
- **Support for Multiline Comments**: Proper handling of comments across multiple lines without causing errors in tokenization.
- **Case Sensitivity**: The lexical analyzer distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase identifiers.
  
---

## Features & Usage

### 1. **Workflow for NFA, DFA, and Regular Expressions**

- The program first accepts a **regular expression** as input.
- It then constructs the **NFA** and displays a **transition table**.
- Using **subset construction**, the NFA is converted into a **DFA**.
- The total number of states and transition tables for both NFA and DFA are shown in the console.

#### Example (NFA to DFA):

```java
// Example of a Regular Expression for a simple language
String regex = "(a|b)*abb";
NFA nfa = new NFA(regex);
DFA dfa = nfa.toDFA();
dfa.displayTransitionTable();
```

### 2. **Lexical Analyzer**

The lexical analyzer tokenizes the source code, handling:

- **Keywords** (e.g., `if`, `else`, `while`).
- **Identifiers** (variable names, function names).
- **Operators** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
- **Literals** (integers, decimals, booleans, characters).
- **Comments** (single-line and multi-line).
- **Whitespace** is ignored.

#### Example (Tokenization):

```java
// Example source code
String sourceCode = "int x = 5 + 3; // Addition";
LexicalAnalyzer lexer = new LexicalAnalyzer(sourceCode);
lexer.tokenize();
```

### 3. **Symbol Table**

The symbol table manages variables, constants, and their scope:

- Tracks **local** and **global variables**.
- Handles **constant values**.
- Validates **data types** for correct assignments.

#### Example (Symbol Table):

```java
// Example of variable declaration and assignment
SymbolTable symbolTable = new SymbolTable();
symbolTable.addVariable("x", "Integer", 5);
symbolTable.addConstant("PI", "Decimal", 3.14159);
```

### 4. **Error Handling**

The error handler identifies and reports errors:

- **Uninitialized variables**.
- **Invalid arithmetic operations**.
- **Mismatched types** during assignments.
  
#### Example (Error Handling):

```java
// Example source code with an error
String sourceCodeWithError = "int x = 5 + true;";
ErrorHandler errorHandler = new ErrorHandler();
errorHandler.checkForErrors(sourceCodeWithError);
```

## Test Input for the Language

Below is a sample **test input** written in the custom language defined for this assignment. This input demonstrates the syntax for variable declarations, arithmetic operations, comments, and scope management.

### Test Input Code

```java
// This is a single-line comment

/* 
   This is a multi-line comment
   It spans multiple lines
*/

// Variable declarations and assignments
x@INT @ 42;
y@DEC @ 3.14159;
z@BOOL @ true;
myChar@CHAR @ 'A';
myStr@STR @ "Hello";
myVar@VAR @ myvar;

// Arithmetic operations
a@INT @ 5 + 3;
b@DEC @ 4.5 * 2;
c@DEC @ 2 ^ 3 + 4;
d@INT @ 10 % 3 + 1;
e@DEC @ 5.2 / 2;

// Complex expressions with parentheses
f@INT @ (5 + 3) * 2;
g@DEC @ ((2.0 + (4.5 * 3.2)) - (1.5 / 2));
h@DEC @ (2.5 ^ 3.0) + 4.2;
i@DEC @ ((5.5 / 2) ^ 3) + 1;

// Invalid assignments (should throw errors or fail validation)
// x@INT @ 5.5 + 3; // Invalid: INT cannot hold a decimal
// z@BOOL @ 1 + 0;  // Invalid: BOOL cannot hold arithmetic operations

// Scopes
{
    x@INT @ 5;
    y@DEC @ 3.14;
    z@BOOL @ false;
}

// Nested scopes
{
    x@INT @ (3 + 2);
    {
        y@DEC @ 4.2 * 3.1;
        z@INT @ ((2 + 3) * (4 - 1));
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Test Input

1. **Single-Line Comments**: 
   - Anything following `//` is treated as a comment and ignored during compilation.
   - Example: `// This is a single-line comment`.

2. **Multi-Line Comments**:
   - These comments can span multiple lines and are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`.
   - Example:
     ```java
     /* 
        This is a multi-line comment
        It spans multiple lines
     */
     ```

3. **Variable Declarations and Assignments**:
   - Variables are declared with the format: `<variableName>@<dataType> @ <value>;`.
   - Supported data types include:
     - `INT`: Integer (whole numbers).
     - `DEC`: Decimal (floating-point numbers).
     - `BOOL`: Boolean (true/false).
     - `CHAR`: Character (single letter, e.g., `'A'`).
     - `STR`: String (text).
     - `VAR`: Variable (which can be assigned another variable's value).
   - Example:
     - `x@INT @ 42;` declares an integer variable `x` and assigns it the value 42.
     - `y@DEC @ 3.14159;` declares a decimal variable `y` and assigns it the value 3.14159.
     - `myChar@CHAR @ 'A';` declares a character variable `myChar` with the value `'A'`.
     - `myStr@STR @ "Hello";` declares a string variable `myStr` with the value `"Hello"`.
     - `myVar@VAR @ myvar;` assigns the value of another variable `myvar` to `myVar`.

4. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - The language supports basic arithmetic operations:
     - Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`), Modulus (`%`), and Exponentiation (`^`).
   - Example:
     - `a@INT @ 5 + 3;` assigns the result of `5 + 3` (which is 8) to the integer variable `a`.
     - `b@DEC @ 4.5 * 2;` assigns the result of `4.5 * 2` (which is 9.0) to the decimal variable `b`.
     - `c@DEC @ 2 ^ 3 + 4;` assigns the result of `2^3 + 4` (which is 12) to the decimal variable `c`.
     - `d@INT @ 10 % 3 + 1;` assigns the result of `10 % 3 + 1` (which is 2) to the integer variable `d`.
     - `e@DEC @ 5.2 / 2;` assigns the result of `5.2 / 2` (which is 2.6) to the decimal variable `e`.

5. **Complex Expressions**:
   - Parentheses are used to enforce precedence in complex expressions.
   - Example:
     - `f@INT @ (5 + 3) * 2;` calculates `(5 + 3)` first, which is `8`, then multiplies it by `2`, resulting in `16`.
     - `g@DEC @ ((2.0 + (4.5 * 3.2)) - (1.5 / 2));` calculates nested operations by following standard arithmetic rules.
     - `h@DEC @ (2.5 ^ 3.0) + 4.2;` computes `2.5^3.0` and then adds `4.2`.
     - `i@DEC @ ((5.5 / 2) ^ 3) + 1;` divides `5.5` by `2`, raises the result to the power of `3`, then adds `1`.

6. **Invalid Assignments**:
   - The lexer should flag errors for invalid operations such as:
     - Assigning a decimal number to an integer (`x@INT @ 5.5 + 3;`).
     - Performing arithmetic operations on a boolean value (`z@BOOL @ 1 + 0;`).
   - These lines are commented out to show the expected errors, but they demonstrate situations where type mismatches should occur.

7. **Scopes**:
   - The language supports variable declarations within **scopes**, defined by curly braces `{}`.
   - Example:
     - Within the block, `x`, `y`, and `z` are local variables with their own values.
   - Nested scopes are also allowed, as seen in the nested block where `y` and `z` are declared inside another block.

8. **Nested Scopes**:
   - The language allows **nested scopes**, where variables can be declared inside other blocks.
   - Example:
     - The outer block declares `x`, and inside the block, a nested block declares `y` and `z`. These variables are scoped locally to their respective blocks.

This test input showcases the basic syntax and structure of the language, including valid and invalid scenarios, to test the functionality of the lexer, error handler, and symbol table. It demonstrates the compiler's ability to process comments, variables, arithmetic, and complex expressions, as well as handle scope management and errors.
