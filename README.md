# @Lang
_Compiler Construction Assignment#1_

## Overview

`@Lang` is a Java-based project designed for **language processing**.
It includes features for working with timestamps and text-related operations, making it a powerful tool for various language-based applications.

## Features

- **Timestamp Handling:** Provides functions for manipulating and formatting timestamps.
- **Text Analysis:** Supports language-based operations such as tokenization, filtering, and transformations.
- **Java-based Implementation:** Written entirely in Java, ensuring robust performance and scalability.

## Installation

To get started with `@Lang`, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tauhaimran/at_Lang.git
   ```
   
2. **Build the Project:**
   You can use your favorite IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) to open the project, or you can build it using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   After building the project, you can run it directly from your IDE or by using the following command:

   ```bash
   mvn exec:java
   ```

## Usage

### Timestamp Handling
- **Add/Modify Timestamps**: Easily add or modify timestamps using the provided utilities.
- **Format Timestamps**: Format timestamps in a variety of formats suitable for different needs (e.g., human-readable formats, ISO8601).

### Text Operations
- **Tokenization**: Split input text into individual tokens for analysis.
- **Filtering**: Remove unwanted characters or phrases from text.
- **Text Transformation**: Perform various transformations on text to meet specific language processing needs.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the timestamp and text utilities:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Timestamp usage
        String timestamp = TimestampUtility.getCurrentTimestamp();
        System.out.println("Current Timestamp: " + timestamp);

        // Text processing
        String inputText = "Hello, this is an example!";
        String processedText = TextUtility.filterText(inputText);
        System.out.println("Processed Text: " + processedText);
    }
}
```
